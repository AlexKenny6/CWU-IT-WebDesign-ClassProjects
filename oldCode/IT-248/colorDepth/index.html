						<p>All color information in a bitmap is stored numerically. To a computer, numbers are stored as a collection of 1's and 0's - also known as binary digits or bits. One bit color only uses a 0 or a 1 to repesent each pixel on a screen. A bitmap with a color depth of 1 bit can only be a pure black and white picture. 4 bit color allows for 16 different colors in the bitmap. (More bits = more possible colors) 8 bit images will allow 256 colors, 16 bit gives over 65 thousand colors and 24 bits will allow 16.7 million colors! Most desktop computer being produced today are capable of displaying 32 bit color images. They contain pallettes of 4,294,967,296 possible colors. (Far greater than the eye can discern.)</p>
						<p>
						Of course, the greater the color depth the more storage space the picture will take. It used to be that for most multimedia work that ended up on the Internet 256 colors (8 bit) worked just fine. But as you can see in the examples above, even 256 colors has a problem with gradients. (Look closely at the sky.) But the greater color depth demands more storage space for each picture. Compression schemes were invented to take all of the raw data in a picture and squeeze it into a smaller package. The most popular compression schemes on the Web today are GIF and JPEG.</p>
