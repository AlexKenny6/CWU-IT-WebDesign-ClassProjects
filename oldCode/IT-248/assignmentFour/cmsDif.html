					<h2>Wordpress<hr></h2>

						<p>Wordpress is a very easy to use content management system that was built to be very easy to use. The platform has a simple log in page to access unqiue information only available to you. Once in your backend, you have the ability to add/delete/edit pages that could range from a product page to a contact form. You also have the ability to add and edit pictures on any page. If you are a little more tech savy, then you can manually edit the html code to make sure everything is looking they way you want it.</p>

					<div id="columnRightBottom">
						<p>Squarespace is a platform that is very similar to what Wordpress can do, however the cms only allows you to add content to certain places on a webpage. To make the page look the way you designed it, you use "spaces" to space out the material. Squarespace has a log in system just like Wordpress and keeps your information safe. After signing up for an account, you will have the ability to create a professional work account with Google Suite.</p>

					<h2>The Bottom Line<hr></h2>
					<div id="columnRightLast">
						<p>At the end of the day, both platforms are very good at what they do. Wordpress has more flexibility in what a user can do and there are less limitations. For example, you can add and drop content easily without worrying about adding "spaces" in-between the content to space it out. Due to more flexibility, Wordpress is easier to use for anyone and they have on-going maintenance to always improve the platfrom. With this, they have a great customer service department that will be there to help anyone out.</p>
