				<h1>Skiing In Washington State</h1>

					<h2>Target Audience</h2>
					<p>
						Skiing in Washington State must be on a person's bucket list. With several resorts and tons of snow, it makes for a place to visit. For those who do not have the time to visit every resort and drive hundreds of miles, we have a list for you. Our target audience will be skiers who are visting Washington State and want to ski at one to three resorts in the few days they are visiting the state.
						<br><br>
						This list will be short and sweet but will be packed with information about each of the three resorts we will discuss. We want to make it easier for you to pick where you'll be going so you can spend less time worrying about where to go and spend more time on the powder.

					<h2>Project Scope</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout the process of creating this website, we will create a website with a lot of information. The biggest goal of this is to provide a visitor with information to prepare them on what mountain resorts they can visit.
						<br><br>
						On the home page, there will be four links. One for the homepage and the others for the three resorts: Stevens Pass, Crytal Resort, and Snoqualmie Pass. After this, each individual page will include basic information about the mountain including weather information, lifts, and runs. After this level, there will be links to the best runs/lifts on each mountain to make sure the audience skis on those. With the amount of ski runs at each mountain, we will highlight the best. 
						<br><br>
						Each page will have a basic two column layout with pictures, links, and animations. Each page will be focused on the user experience and will be responsive.
